## Strategy

A week before the project started, we got together in meetings to brainstorm our project's scope and functionality by creating  wireframes, discussing required technologies, and finalizing our team's roles and responsibilities. We  split into two mini groups to work on the front and back end of the project, and met every couple of days to ensure we were on track and to avoid merge conflicts while pushing and pulling our code. We decided to use several API's for the dictionary and thesaurus functionality for the user. We mob programmed some aspects of the front and back end to ensure each team member had an understanding.
